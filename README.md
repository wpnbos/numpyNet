# numpyNet
neural net implemented in bare Python + Numpy through following along the steps in https://nnfs.io/

to try it out, install the requirements (2 packages)
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

and then run the code
`python numpyNet.py`

to test my understanding of the code I implemented the custom optimizer [Rprop](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=AE3B1B91CD6B57CC4B3941931E66F3EB?doi=10.1.1.21.3428&rep=rep1&type=pdf) in the class `optimizer_rprop`. 
this optimizer is used by default when running the .py file.
